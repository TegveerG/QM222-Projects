# QM222-Projects
In the United States, the number of individuals obtaining a college degree has significantly increased. As a result, there is an ongoing debate on the importance and benefit of receiving a college education. 

Part A of the report focuses on exploring the source of the gap between non-college graduates and college graduates, using descriptive statistics and graphing commands.

Part B of this report will analyze the effect of a college degree on earnings. The effect of a college degree will be measured by analyzing its effect when holding other variables constant. These other variables include gender, area of residence, cognitive ability, and hours worked.

Thanks to Andrew Zheng for working with me on these projects.
